      <p>Dhuandhar falls are located in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Pradesh.
           The beautiful falls cascade down for 30 m and are also one of the most visited tourist attractions in Jabalpur.
            The river Narmada flows through the famous marble-like falls, narrows down and plunges into a waterfall 
            so forcefully that it creates a bouncing mass of mist and results into the Dhuandhar falls.
           The plunges are so powerful that its uproar can be heard from a far-off distance.
          Viewing platforms have been constructed along the side to facilitate proper views.
         Make sure that you do not cross these railings. There lies a bed of white and grey marble rocks
          below the water that further enhances the whitish colour of the waterfall. The view is spectacular 
          and the surroundings are always chock-full with tourists wanting to get a glimpse of the falls.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Weather</b> : 36Â° C <br></li>
      <li><b>Timings</b> : 7 am-7 pm and 8 pm-midnight only on Full moon nights. <br></li>
      <li><b>Entry Fee</b>: INR 30 per head per side for boat </li>
   </ul>

            <summary><b>Things To Do at Dhuandhar Falls</b></summary>
            <p><b>Boat Ride:</b> Take a boat ride on the River Narmada especially during sunsets and witness the white marble turning yellow. The 6 km boat ride takes you through narrow gorges guarded by sheer cliffs rising to a height of 100 feet and is an experience that should not be missed. The rides are suspended during the monsoon season due to heavy water inflow though it is regularly offered from November to May.
                                 The rides are available at INR 100 per person for a 45 min ride.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Cable Car:</b> You can access the cable car services from both the east and west side of the waterfall. You can also access it from the one available at Bhedaghat if you are willing to see the other side of the falls. The ropeway facilities start from the eastern bend of the river and take you all the way to the western side.
                It cost around INR 85 per person for a complete trip.
                <br>
                The ride is offered from 10:30 AM to 6:30 PM.
                <br>
                <br><br>
                <b>Picnic on the riverside:</b> The ambience of the environment here is very aesthetic, and the sounds of the falling water are like music to the ears. All this makes it an ideal picnic spot. Just get some food and enjoy with your family or friends.
                Shopping for marble: Various marble statues of Hindu Gods, handicrafts and trinkets are also available for sale to the tourists. You can get a customized nameplate or keychains from the vendors as well. Just order them before going to visit the falls, and by the time you come back, your items will be ready.</p>

            <summary><b>Best Time To Visit Dhuandhar Falls</b></summary>
            <p>The best time to visit the fall is from September to March. During the summers the weather is quite hot and rainy season brings a huge inflow of water, making the fall a little dangerous. However, the best way to make the trip a memorable one is to visit the falls during Sharad Purnima when the Narmada Mahotsav is going on.</p>
