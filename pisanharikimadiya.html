      <p>Located on top of a small hill of about 300 ft in height, this is a beautiful temple of the Jains, attracting tourists and pilgrims with its architectural beauty and splendour. Instead of a single temple, it is a temple complex with a number of temples. The legend behind the construction of the temple says that it was built about 500 years ago by an old woman, who collected the money for the construction by grinding flour on a hand driven stone grinder. With her will and dedication she collected enough money to build the temple. Another story is that it was built by a Jain Peshwa of the Gond Rajputs.
          <br>
          Surrounded with plants and trees and located on top of the hill, the temple complex and the surrounding area provide you a peaceful atmosphere where you may spend a lot of time praying or in meditation. You may spend hours together here enjoying the natural beauty. You need at least two to three hours in hand to fully explore the temple and enjoy its beauty.
